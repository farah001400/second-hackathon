            <h1>Why Does It <span style="color: #ff0077;">Work?</span></h1>
            <p>
                Not all probiotics are the same. The overall biological action od a probiotics is not simply the sum of
                its individual components' action but the result of a complex network of relationship between the
                microorganisms it contains and the human host. Unlike many other poroducts on the market, the clinical
                results obtained from CDS22-formula speak louder thanany techinacal description.
            </p>
            <p>
                CDS22-fprmula combines 8 bacterial strains selected for their biochemical and enzymatic profiles and
                specifically calibrated in precise proportions to synergistically act on the physiology of the human
                gastrointestinal tract.it is crucial to emphasize that the production of the Formulazion De Simone falls
                within the field of biology, not chemistry, as the bacteria forming the product's base are living
                organisms. Their cultivation requires advanced scientific knowledge and specific know-how, still
                protected by industrial secrecy.
            </p>
            <p>
                The unique and advanced know-how developed by Prof. Claudio De Simone, which includes specific
                industrial secrets, contributes to the uniqueness and efficacy of CDS22-formula, making it extremely
                difficult for others to replicate or produce an identical or functionally equivalent product. Supported
                by solid scientific evidence, CDS22-formula is highly effective in the dietary management of dysbiosis
                and other gastrointestinal conditions, offering proven and replicable clinical results.

                    Intestinal dysbiosis is a condition where the natural balance of microorganisms in the intestine
                    is altered, causing various gastrointestinal disorders. Controlling dysbiosis is crucial for
                    maintaining digestive health, improving patients comfort, and contributing to overall
                    well-being, even in cases of chronic intestinal disorders like irritable bowel syndrome,

            <h1>De <span class="highlight-pink">Simone</span> Formulation</h1>
            <p>
                The De Simone Formulation contained in CDS22-formula is the result of pioneering research by Professor
                Claudio De Simone (MD, FAGA), who redefined therapeutic approaches to intestinal health by introducing
                the use of high-concentration probiotic mixtures to dietetically manage acute and chronic
                gastrointestinal disorders.
            </p>
            <p>
                His interest in the intestinal microbiota dates back to the 1980s when the importance of the intestinal
                flora’s role was just beginning to be understood. Professor De Simone is an honorary member of the
                American College of Gastroenterology and, after graduating in Medicine and Surgery, specialized in
                gastroenterology, allergology, and clinical immunology. He taught Infectious Diseases at the University
                of L’Aquila (Italy).
            </p>
            <p>
                He has published over 200 clinical studies, scientific articles, and book chapters.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since the commercial launch of his renowned De Simone Formulation in the 1990s, the Professor has
                actively advocated for better regulation and quality control of probiotics, highlighting the potential
                health and well-being risks.
            </p>
            <p>
                As emphasized by Professor De Simone in numerous conferences and publications, many marketed probiotics
                have not been clinically tested or may not correspond to the original clinically tested formulations
                when marketed, causing substantial differences in the safety and efficacy of the final product (<a
                    href="#">De Simone C. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology Vol. 16 No. 9 2018</a>).
            </p>
            <p>
                Current regulations often do not require thorough comparative studies to ensure that changes in
                manufacturing processes do not compromise the efficacy and safety of the commercially distributed
                probiotic product.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="sections">
            <h1>There is ONE <span class="highlight-pink">De Simone</span> Formulation</h1>
            <p>
                The lack of strict regulation and the possibility for manufacturers to modify formulations without
                adequately informing consumers pose a threat to public trust. In the past, the De Simone Formulation
                (DSF) was sold under the brand name VSL#3®, by VSL Pharmaceuticals and Actial Srl.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2019, VSL#3® distributors were found guilty of false advertising (for more information: <a
                    href="#">Federal Judge Upholds $18M Verdict, Blocks False Advertising of VSL#3, Schulman
                    Bhattacharya</a>). Recently, the European Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) has updated its
                guidelines to clarify that pre-2016 literature references to VSL#3® exclusively refer to DSF (<a
                    href="#">ECCO, ECCO News, 2023</a>). In 2024, ESPEN (European Society for Clinical Nutrition and
                Metabolism) published the article “<a href="#">Clarifying Correct Attributions in Scientific Literature:
                    The Case of the De Simone Formulation and VSL#3®</a>,” which reiterates the above.
            </p>
            <p>
                The De Simone Formulation is sold under the brand name “Visbiome” in the USA and Canada (Exegi) and
                under the brand name “De Simone Formulation” in Korea (HectoHealthcare).
